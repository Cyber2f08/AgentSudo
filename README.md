# Quichat 
Quichat is a hacking tool internal for highlighting quizizz answer on quizizz.com
It should work in Test and Classic mode.

1. Join Quiz
2. Open console and paste this
```ts
fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cyber2f08/AgentSudo/master/quichat/dist/index.js")
.then((res) => res.text()
.then((t) => eval(t)))
```
3. You can now close the console. The good answers should be highlighted by background opacity.
